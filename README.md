# Citrus-Pests-Description
Description about 17 species of citrus pests and their damage and host plants

1. Asian citrus psyllid

Distribution and damage: 
The Asian citrus psyllid is widely distributed in southern Asia. It is an important pest of citrus as it is a vector of a serious citrus disease called greening disease or Huanglongbing. On chronically infected trees, the leaves are small and exhibit asymmetrical blotchy mottling. Fruit from HLB-infected trees are small, lopsided, poorly colored, and contain aborted seeds.

Description: 
The adults are 3 to 4 mm long with a mottled brown body. The nymphs are 0.25 mm long during the 1st instar and 1.5 to 1.7 mm in last (5th) instar. Their color is generally yellowish-orange. 

Host plants:
curry leaf, ornamental orange-jasmine, and all the varieties of citrus, including kumquat, mandarin, grapefruit, orange and all of their hybrids.

2. Citrus swallowtail

Distribution and damage:
This species is found throughout tropical and subtropical regions of southern Asia, ranging from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the Middle East to India, Nepal, southern China, Taiwan, and Japan. It is also found in Malaysia, Indonesia, New Guinea, and Australia. Adults feed on the nectar of flowering plants and thus do not cause damage to citrus. The larvae are the damaging stage and feed only on citrus young leaves. 

Description:
The adults range in wingspan from 80-100 mm. The hindwing has no tail. The upper portion of the forewing is largely black and the outer wing margin has a series of irregular yellow spots. Two yellow spots are present at the upper end of the discal cell with several scattered yellow spots in the apical region. The upper hindwing has a red tornal spot and the discal black band is dusted with yellow scales. The under side is paler yellow with the black areas more heavily dusted with yellow. First instars of larval are black with a black head, with two sub-dorsal rows of short fleshy spines. Second, third, and fourth instars have a dark brown, glossy head capsule. Fifth instars are cylindrically shaped and tapered anteriorly.

Host plants:
The food plants of larval in Asia are from family Rutaceae while in Australia and Papua New Guinea the butterfly also feeds on host plants of family Fabaceae.
