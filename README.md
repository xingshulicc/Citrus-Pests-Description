# Citrus-Pests-Description
Description about 17 species of citrus pests and their damage and host plants

1. Asian citrus psyllid

Distribution and damage: 
The Asian citrus psyllid is widely distributed in southern Asia. It is an important pest of citrus as it is a vector of a serious citrus disease called greening disease or Huanglongbing. On chronically infected trees, the leaves are small and exhibit asymmetrical blotchy mottling. Fruit from HLB-infected trees are small, lopsided, poorly colored, and contain aborted seeds.

Description: 
The adults are 3 to 4 mm long with a mottled brown body. The nymphs are 0.25 mm long during the 1st instar and 1.5 to 1.7 mm in last (5th) instar. Their color is generally yellowish-orange. 

Host plants:
curry leaf, ornamental orange-jasmine, and all the varieties of citrus, including kumquat, mandarin, grapefruit, orange and all of their hybrids.

2. Citrus swallowtail

Distribution and damage:
This species is found throughout tropical and subtropical regions of southern Asia, ranging from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the Middle East to India, Nepal, southern China, Taiwan, and Japan. It is also found in Malaysia, Indonesia, New Guinea, and Australia. Adults feed on the nectar of flowering plants and thus do not cause damage to citrus. The larvae are the damaging stage and feed only on citrus young leaves. 

Description:
The adults range in wingspan from 80-100 mm. The hindwing has no tail. The upper portion of the forewing is largely black and the outer wing margin has a series of irregular yellow spots. Two yellow spots are present at the upper end of the discal cell with several scattered yellow spots in the apical region. The upper hindwing has a red tornal spot and the discal black band is dusted with yellow scales. The under side is paler yellow with the black areas more heavily dusted with yellow. First instars of larval are black with a black head, with two sub-dorsal rows of short fleshy spines. Second, third, and fourth instars have a dark brown, glossy head capsule. Fifth instars are cylindrically shaped and tapered anteriorly.

Host plants:
The food plants of larval in Asia are from family Rutaceae while in Australia and Papua New Guinea the butterfly also feeds on host plants of family Fabaceae.

3. Forktailed bush katydid

Distribution and damage:
The pest is widespread in the eastern and southeastern United States. Nymphs of this species feed on young fruit at petal fall. Katydids take a single bite from a fruit and then move to another feeding site on the same or nearby fruit. In this way, a few katydids can damage a large quantity of fruit in a short time. They also eat holes in leaves and maturing fruit, creating injury that resembles damage by citrus cutworm.

Description:
The adults are 14 - 75 mm in length, dark green, Narrow wings with rounded tips are held along the body at rest. Males have an unusual forked appendage at the end of their abdomen called a furcula. Katydids have much longer antennae than grasshoppers, averaging 39 mm. The white rings evident on the immature katydids are faintly visible.

Host plants:
sweet orange, Citrus sinensis

4. Southern green stink bug

Distribution and damage:
The southern green stink bug is believed to have originated in Ethiopia. Its distribution now includes the tropical and subtropical regions of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. The damage on fruit from their punctures is hard brownish or black spots. These punctures affect the fruits edible qualities and decidedly lower its market value. In addition to the visual damage caused by southern green stink bug feeding, the mechanical transmission of bacterial spot may also result.

Description:
The nymphs in the first instars are light yellowish in color with red eyes and transparent legs and antennae. The second instar has black legs, head, thorax, and antennae. The third and fourth instars differ from the second in size and an overall greenish color is becoming apparent. The adult is shield-shaped with an overall dull green color. The eyes are dark red or black. Small black dots can be found along the sides of the abdomen. The wings completely cover the abdomen.

Host plants:
It prefers woody hosts including basswood, mulberry, pear, maple; yet it is a common pest of vegetable and field crops such as lima beans, green beans, soybean, tomato, cotton, eggplant, and cucumber.

5. Fruit piercing moth

Distribution and damage:
This species of pest is found in large parts of the tropics, mainly in Asia, Africa and Australia but introduced into other areas such as Hawaii, New Zealand and the Society Islands. It is one of major fruit pests in the world. Both sexes of adult fruit piercing moths puncture fruit with their long, stout proboscis which is adapted to penetrate the rind of firm, intact fruit allowing moths to feed on fruit juice and pulp.  Secondary invasions by micro-organisms spread into damaged tissues causing rot and premature fruit-fall. 

Description:
The adult moths are large and stout-bodied, with a wingspan of 100 mm. The forewings can be mainly brown, cream or green. Hind wings are yellow orange, with black patches and spots.

Host plants:
A wide range of cultivated and wild fruits, including banana, citrus, 5-corner fruit, guava, mango, passion fruit, pineapple, and in outbreak years, capsicum, melon and tomato.

6. Asian long-horned beetle

Distribution and damage:
Asian long-horned beetle is native to eastern China, Japan, and Korea. This species has now been accidentally introduced into the United States, as well as Canada, and several countries of Europe.
